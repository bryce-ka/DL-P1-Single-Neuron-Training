# DL-P1-Single-Neuron-Training-

## Overview
In this project me and a classmate worked together to build single neuron models for linear and logistic regression. This project was expanded upon throughout the semester to ultimately become a deep learning model that was essentially built from scratch. This project provided me with a strong foundation in machine learning fundamentals and and helped me understand the inner workings of machine and deep learning algorithms in addition to how to use and apply them.

## Project Structure
This project comprises the following essential files:
- `single neuron model.jl`: I've included functions related to neuron activation, prediction, loss computation, and gradient calculation in this file.
- `single neuron training.jl`: You'll find the training logic for updating model parameters using gradient descent in this file.
- Jupyter notebook Demonstration.ipynb: This notebook serves as a demonstration of the code and its functionality. There's also a pdf version of the notebook.

## Objectives
Throughout this project, I aimed to achieve the following goals:
1. Understand single-neuron models for classification and regression.
2. Learn how to train machine learning models using gradient descent.

I've implemented various functions, including:
- Linear activation and its derivative.
- Sigmoid activation and its derivative.
- Prediction functions for single-neuron models.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss computation.
- Accuracy measurement for classification models.
- Gradient computation for training.
- The training function using gradient descent.

## Usage
Here's how you can use this project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the provided Jupyter notebook to see a step-by-step demonstration of the code and its usage.

## Partners and Groups
For this assignment, I worked closely with my assigned partner. Collaboration and ensuring that our code is readable to others were crucial aspects of our work.

## Submission
This GitHub repository serves as my submission for the project. I've committed my work as I progressed through the assignment.
